# Quick Start Guide ‚Äî Webhook Version 2.0

**üéâ New in v2.0: Real-time webhook-based processing!**

This version uses Notion webhooks for instant processing instead of polling. Your transcripts are processed within seconds of being added to Notion.

**‚ú® Uses modern `data_source` events** (2025-09-03 API) for reliable database monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- A Notion account with a workspace
- An Anthropic (Claude) API account
- A Render account (free tier is fine)

## Step 1: Get Your Notion Credentials

### Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click "+ New integration"
3. Name it (e.g., "Voice Transcript Automation")
4. Select your workspace
5. Set the capabilities:
   - **Content Capabilities**: Enable "Read content" and "Insert content"
   - **Comment Capabilities**: (optional, not needed for this workflow)
   - **User Capabilities**: Choose "No user information" (or as needed)
6. Click "Submit"
7. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)

### Get Your Database ID

1. Open your "Raw Transcripts" database in Notion
2. **Click "Share" ‚Üí Add your integration** (This is crucial! Your integration must be connected to the database to receive webhook events)
3. Copy the database URL: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/[DATABASE_ID]?v=...`
4. The DATABASE_ID is the 32-character string (with dashes removed if present)

   **üí° Important**: When your integration is added to the database, it automatically gets access to all child pages added to that database. This is why the `data_source.content_updated` event works reliably.

### Get Your Parent Page ID

1. Open the page where you want task pages created
2. Click "Share" ‚Üí Add your integration
3. Copy the page URL: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/[PAGE_ID]`
4. The PAGE_ID is the 32-character string

## Step 2: Get Your Anthropic API Key

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Create a new key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

## Step 3: Deploy to Render

### Create a Render Account

1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy deployment)
3. The **free tier is perfect** for this project

### Deploy Your Application

**Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)**

1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account

2. In Render dashboard, click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Web Service"**

3. Connect your GitHub repository

4. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration

5. Click **"Apply"** to create the service

**Option B: Deploy from Git URL**

1. In Render dashboard, click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Web Service"**

2. Choose **"Public Git repository"**

3. Enter your repository URL

4. Configure manually:
   - **Name**: `notion-automation`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install uv && uv sync`
   - **Start Command**: `uv run uvicorn webhook_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### Configure Environment Variables

In your Render service settings, add these environment variables:

```env
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_your_token_here
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=your_parent_page_id_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_key_here
```

**Important**: Leave `WEBHOOK_SECRET` empty for now. We'll add it in Step 5.

### Get Your Webhook URL

After deployment completes, Render will provide a URL like:

```
https://notion-automation-xxxx.onrender.com
```

Your webhook endpoint will be:

```
https://notion-automation-xxxx.onrender.com/webhook
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note about Free Tier:**

- The free tier **sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity**
- First webhook after sleep will take **30-60 seconds** to wake up
- This is perfectly fine for transcript processing!
- If you need instant response, upgrade to $7/month paid tier

## Step 4: Set Up Notion Webhook

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations

2. Click on your integration (from Step 1)

3. Navigate to the **"Webhooks"** tab

4. Click **"+ Create a subscription"**

5. Enter your webhook URL:

   ```
   https://your-app-name.onrender.com/webhook
   ```

6. Select these event types:

   - ‚úÖ `data_source.content_updated`

   **Why this event?** This is the modern event type (new in 2025-09-03 API) that triggers when database content changes, such as when pages are added or updated. It's more reliable than page events because your integration inherits access from the database level.

7. Click **"Create subscription"**

## Step 5: Verify Your Webhook

1. **Check your Render logs** (in the Render dashboard, click "Logs"):

   ```
   üîê Received verification token
   Token: secret_xxxYOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_WILL_APPEAR_HERExxx
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Copy this token to your Notion webhook settings to complete verification!
   ```

2. **Copy the verification token** from the logs

3. Go back to Notion webhooks tab and click **"‚ö†Ô∏è Verify"**

4. Paste the token and click **"Verify subscription"**

5. **Add the token to Render environment variables:**

   - Go to your Render service ‚Üí Environment
   - Add new variable:
     ```
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret_xxxYOUR_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1xxx
     ```
   - This enables signature validation for security

6. Your webhook is now **active** ‚úÖ

## Step 6: Test with a Sample Transcript

1. Go to your "Raw Transcripts" database in Notion

2. Create a new entry with text in the "Transcript" property:

```
I need to finish the quarterly report by Friday.
First, I should compile the sales data from Q3.
Then analyze the customer feedback survey results.
Finally, create the executive summary presentation.
Also need to schedule a review meeting with the team.
```

3. **Within 1-2 minutes** (or 30-60 seconds if free tier was sleeping), your transcript will be processed!

4. Check your parent page - you should see a new child page created with:
   - Title: Current day and date (e.g., "Monday [10/28/25]")
   - Summary section
   - Task checklist

## Expected Output

In your Render logs, you'll see:

```
üì® Received webhook event: data_source.content_updated
‚úì Event is from target database
‚úì Found 1 updated block(s)
‚úì Processing block as page: abc123...
üìù Processing page: abc123...
‚úì Found transcript (247 chars)
ü§ñ Sending to Claude API...
üìÑ Creating Notion page...
‚úÖ Created page: Monday [10/28/25]
üîó URL: https://notion.so/...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Check Render logs for errors**

- Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Logs
- Look for any error messages

**Webhook subscription not active**

- Verify your webhook is active in Notion integration settings
- Status should show ‚úÖ Active, not ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending
- Ensure `data_source.content_updated` event is selected in the subscription

**Integration doesn't have access**

- Go to your database in Notion
- Click "..." ‚Üí Connections
- Ensure your integration is connected **to the database itself** (not just individual pages)
- The integration needs database-level access to receive `data_source.content_updated` events

### Events Received But Not Processing

**"No transcript text found"**

- Ensure your database has a property named exactly **"Transcript"**
- The property should be type "Text" or "Rich Text"
- Verify the property contains actual text

**"Authentication failed"**

- Double-check your `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable in Render
- Ensure the integration has access to both the database AND parent page

**Claude API errors**

- Verify your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid
- Check you have available credits at https://console.anthropic.com/

### Slow Response (30-60 seconds)

This is **normal on the free tier** when the service has been sleeping. Options:

1. **Accept the delay** ‚Äî it's fine for transcript processing
2. **Upgrade to paid tier** ($7/month) for always-on, instant response

### Invalid Signature Errors

- Make sure you added the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Render environment variables
- The secret should match the `verification_token` from Step 5
- If you recreate the webhook, you'll get a new token

## üí∞ Cost Summary

### Free Tier (Recommended for Most Users)

- **Render Hosting**: $0/month
  - 750 hours/month (24/7 coverage)
  - 100GB bandwidth
  - Sleeps after 15 min inactivity (30-60s wake time)
- **Anthropic API**: ~$0.003 per transcript

  - Example: 100 transcripts/month ‚âà $0.30
  - Example: 1000 transcripts/month ‚âà $3.00

- **Notion API**: Free ‚úÖ

**Total for 100 transcripts/month: ~$0.30** üéâ

### Hidden Costs?

‚ùå **No surprises!** The only variable cost is Claude API usage, which is transparent and based on transcript length.

## Testing Locally (Development Only)

If you want to test locally before deploying:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Create `.env` file (copy from `env.example`):

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
uv run python webhook_server.py
```

4. Use **ngrok** to create a public URL:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

5. Use the ngrok URL for your Notion webhook

**Note**: This is only for testing. For production, deploy to Render.

## Monitoring Your Service

### View Logs

- Go to Render dashboard
- Click on your service
- Click "Logs" tab
- You'll see real-time webhook events and processing

### Health Check
